📊 Sales Analysis Dashboard

This project demonstrates how to transform raw sales data into actionable business insights using SQL Server for data storage and queries, and Power BI for visualization and reporting.

🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to help the Sales Manager and Representatives move from static sales reports to interactive dashboards. By integrating SQL Server and Power BI, the team can now explore sales data dynamically, track performance against budget, and make data-driven decisions.

data/ → Sample SQL scripts and database schema.

powerbi/ → Power BI report files (.pbix).

docs/ → Supporting documentation and screenshots.

🔍 Key Business Questions Answered

How well are sales aligned with the budget?
→ Sales exceeded the 2021 budget by over 1 million, showing positive performance.

Which customers generate the highest revenue?
